# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

# Example 1:

# Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
#              Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
# Example 2:

# Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
